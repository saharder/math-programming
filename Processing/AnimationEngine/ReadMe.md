A note on some of the dependencies of this project. 

# Known Bugs

1. If there are discontinuities in the domain for the Plot Class, or certain areas where the function is undefined, then Plot does not connect the dots in the correct way. 
2. I installed pdf2svg so that I could convert a pdf to an svg file format that Processing would play nicely with. I encountered an error where my svg display was not at all correct (it was all smooshed).
