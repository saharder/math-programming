# What you need to run these files

1. Valid LaTeX Distribution which includes the command line tool dvipng
2. Processing (3.0 or later) and all its depencies.

# Known Bugs

1. If there are discontinuities in the domain for the Plot Class, or certain areas where the function is undefined, then Plot does not connect the dots in the correct way. 
2. Processing does not like accepting svg files. 

# Ideas for Future Animation

1. Create a class for the "magnifying glass" effect. 
2. Make an animation of a Mobius transformation. Show its relation to affine transformations. 
3. Illustrate the process of diagonalization by animation. 
4. Illustrate least squares using springs. 
5. Illustrate the brachistocrone problem. 
6. Animate Markov Processes
7. Animate some random walks.
8. Animate the central limit theorem. 
9. Animate some geometric derivatives. 
10. Implement labeling and brackets. 
11. (Possible) Build up a png library of the most common LaTeX commands (all letters)
12. Implement animation of letters (preferably with LaTeX fonts)
13.
